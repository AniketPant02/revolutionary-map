# _The Underdogs_: An Interactive Visualization of the Movements of Revolutionary Generals during the Mexican Revolution

Here, we serve an interactive geospatial visualization of the movements of generals Obregon, Villa, and Macias during the Mexican Revolution.
Data for Villa and Obregon's movements is gathered from [the University of Texas at Austin Perry-Casta√±eda Library Map Collection](https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/atlas_mexico/constitutionalist_revolt.jpg). Macias's movements were extrapolated from the text, Mariano Azuela's *The Underdogs*. 

This visualization is developed by the JCIB ForensX Team: Aniket Pant (aniketpant@jefcoed.com), Lonnie Webb (lonniewebb@jefcoed.com), Viraj Kacker (virajkacker@jefcoed.com), and Cole McKee (colemckee@jefcoed.com). We welcome any questions and pull-requests.
